This project is aimed at classifying the speech signals of people with dysarthria from a population of patients and controls. 
Source of speech samples: TORGO database which is a collaborative effort between the departments of Computer Science and Speech-Language Pathology at the University of Toronto and the Holland-Bloorview Kids Rehab hospital in Toronto. 
This comprehensive resource contains speech samples from individuals with dysarthria (due to cerebral palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and healthy controls, representing both genders.
Feature considered: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) 
Classifier: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
